# Telco_Churn_Analysis

### Telco Churn Feature Engineering

#### Problem Statement

A machine learning model is requested to be developed to predict customers who will leave the company. You are expected to perform the necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps before developing the model.

#### Data Set

The Telco customer churn data includes information about a fictitious telecom company that provides home phone and Internet services to 7043 customers in California during the third quarter. It shows which customers have left, stayed, or signed up for the service.
